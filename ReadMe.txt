FizzBuzz
==========================================================================
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. If it’s a multiple 
of 3, it should print “Fizz”. If it’s a multiple of 5, it should print 
“Buzz”. If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, it should print “FizzBuzz”.

According to some articles online, 199 out of 200 for programming jobs
cannot write code for this. While I believe that may be hyperbole, assuming
it is true I wanted to demonstrate that I am one of the 1 in 200 who can
write it.

I have written a version of FizzBuzz in several different languages:
Java, C++
